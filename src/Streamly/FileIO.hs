-- File APIs exposed to users
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The following references may be useful to build an understanding about the
-- file API design:
--
-- http://www.linux-mag.com/id/308/ for blocking/non-blocking IO on linux.
-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_file_input/output for C APIs.
-- https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/file.html for Java API.
-- https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/ for http file API.
--
-- Design Notes:
--
-- We can have handle based APIs as well as filepath based APIs to read. There
-- are a few advantages of handle based APIs:
--
-- 1) The file may get renamed or removed if not locked. Using a handle we do
-- not need to lock the namespace, we can create a file and delete it and still
-- keep using the handle.
--
-- 2) A pure "fromFile" API would require opening a handle each time the API is
-- used. If we have to read from the file many times, it requires a path lookup
-- each time and if the reads are concurrent each read would require a separate
-- OS handle, which is a limited resource.
--
-- Handles are stateful and we would like to avoid them, but they are
-- ubiquitous and many cases we are forced to use them. Handles like 'stdin',
-- 'stdout', 'stderr' are very common. Though we could use @fromFile
-- /dev/stdin@ or @fromStdin@ etc. the former is not so elegant and the later
-- would require multiple APIs for each special handle.

-- Design Notes:
--
-- To represent the range to read we have chosen (start, size) instead of
-- (start, end). This removes the ambiguity of whether "end" is included in the
-- range or not. Also, for non-seekable devices (e.g. terminals) "end" would
-- not make sense as start does not make sense.
--
-- We could avoid specifying the end of the stream and just use "take size" on
-- the stream, but it could be useful to avoid unnecessary readaheads beyond
-- the end point that the consumer wants. Not reading more than required is
-- especially important when reading from stdin.
--
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- APIs for seekable devices
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Seekable Devices:
--
-- We could use a negative start offset to represent reading from the end.
-- However, there is an awkward case, we cannot represent reading the last
-- element because we cannot use 0 as a negative offset. Though the
-- last element can be read using forward reading, but you will have to know
-- the filesize for that, defeating the purpose of negative offset.  To avoid
-- this problem, we can use an offsetType to denote offset from start or from
-- end. We can even use an Either for that.
--
-- We could use a negative size to read backwards, this may not be very useful
-- when reading from files (and may not even apply to terminals) but could be
-- useful when reading slices from arrays, so we can keep the convention for
-- files as well treating them as byte arrays. To keep this option open we
-- currently treat negative size as an error.

-- | This API applies to devices or files which have the seek capability and
-- are of finite size. Therefore, we can read from a given position or specify
-- the read position from the end of file. This type of handles include disks,
-- files, memory devices and excludes terminals, pipes, sockets and fifos.
--
-- @fromHandlePosLenWith chunkSize handle pos len@ streams up to len bytes from
-- @handle@. @pos@ with 'Left' constructor specifies an offset from the
-- beginning of the file, with 'Right' constructor it specifies a negative
-- offset from the end of the file i.e. @filesize - pos@ from the beginning.
--
-- If @size@ is specified then a total of @size@ bytes are read starting from
-- the start point, unless the file ends before @size@ bytes could be read.
-- When @size@ is not specified it keeps streaming until end of file is
-- reached.
--
-- The slice starts at the offset @start@ from the beginning of file
-- and extends up to but not including @end@. Reads are performed in chunks of
-- size @chunkSzie@.
-- when @end@ is not specified it is assumed to be the end
-- of file. If @start@ (or @end@) is negative then it is calculated as @size +
-- start@ where @size@ is the size of the file. If @end < start@ a @nil@
-- stream is returned. If @start@ or @end@ is more than the size of the file it
-- is truncated to the size of the file.
--
-- For block devices, to avoid reading partial blocks @chunkSize@ must align
-- with the block size of the underlying device. If the underlying block size
-- is unknown, it is a good idea to keep it a multiple 4KiB. This API ensures
-- that the start of each chunk is aligned with @chunkSize@ from second chunk
-- onwards.
